# Blindle

This is a game created by a front-end poor experienced student.
Just like other color distinguishing game, this game is a gray scale version.
Which means you have to choose a answer color block in 2\*2, 3\*3 or 4\*4 block matrix.  
And the answer will always be the 'lighter' one, just for clarifying, here is an example.

So obviously, the answer is the answer.
